# Tutorial on how to build an IoT-Intercom
## Short Overview
This IoT device makes it possible to receive a message sent from a mobile phone or other network device and then reply with button clicks. Following project is the result of an IoT course at LNU Sweden. My name is Alexander Str√∂m (as227nn) and following is a tutorial on how to build your own!

## What is this? And how does it work? (Detailed Overview)
This device receives a message sent by a Node-RED dashboard, Node-RED is a flow based programming environment which handles all the traffic from and to the device as well as the cloud solution chosen in this project. When a message is sent, it will be shown on the IoT-Intercom as well as an LED light and buzzer sound. The person who has the device will be able to choose an answer that will be sent back to Node-RED. Node-RED will only store the current question, answer and time to answer while Ubidots will be used to store all messages, also giving an average value of answer time. This tutorial will explain how to set up all this.


**How much time it might take to do (approximation):**

Considering everything working as expected without any unmentioned problems with solutions this project might take 2 days, or approximation 15-20 hours to complete.

## Origin
### Project idea and purpose:
This project idea started from an earlier software solution called "Matroparen" (Enligsh: Food announcements), that acted as a way to tell everybody at home that the food was to be served. This was pretty simple and built upon webhooks messaging devices. But now it wanted something more complex and connected to the IoT spectrum with some hardware and circuitry involved. The way this device is built also makes it possible to collect data such of how long it takes for the person to answer the question.

### Insights
Completing this project will give a brief understanding of the IoT world as well as some basic circuitry, cloud solutions and programming (mainly python). You will also get a brief understanding on some communication protocols and solutions used in it for example: MQTT and HTTP Requests

| Heltec LoRa v2/ESP32 ![Heltec LoRa v2](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fG2O+CUFL._AC_SL1000_.jpg) | Heltec LoRa v2 has been used in this<br>project, but no LoRa is used so almost <br>any ESP32 based device will work as well.  The choosen Heltec development board is based on ESP32 which is a low-cost and low-powered system on a chip with intergrated WiFi and Bluetooth possiblities, and the Heltec one also comes with LoRa. Development board makes it easy to connect to components with their pins located on the sides.                                                                                                                     | [amazon.se](https://www.amazon.se/gp/product/B078M74NNN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 300kr                 |

## Computer setup
To be able to program the deivce an IDE is needed, which is a coding enviroment that handles all needed processes. For this tutorial Atom is used, therefore the first step is to download and setup Atom here: https://atom.io/.

Before we can program the device we need to flash it with its correct firmware, so connect the device with a micro USB cable to your computer. And if your on Windows you will need to install the driver first [here](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip) One way of doing this is to visit the website: https://nabucasa.github.io/esp-web-flasher/. In the top right corner is a connect button, but before pressing this you will need to set the baud which is 460800 for both the heltec and a generic ESP32. After clicking connect you choose the serial port from the popup. The terminal will let you know if connect, if so please erase the device. Then you choose to upload file in the first offset, [here is the file for heltec](https://github.com/H-Ryan/Heltec/blob/main/PyCom%20MicroPython/Heltec%20PyCom%20MicroPython.zip?raw=true) and [here is the file for ESP32](https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp32-20220117-v1.18.bin). When all done and sucessfully flashed we can continue on in Atom.

</br>_Figure 3.1 image that choose ESP Web Flasher website with erase and upload_

Before connecting to the device its recomended to turn off Safe-Boot in Atom global settings. After this you will be able to connect to the device from the
COM3 interface on Windows. On mac you will need to find the device adress, this can be done with terminal command: ```ls /dev/```, it should look something like ```/dev/tty.usbserial-0001```. Set this under the device adress (list) option in Atom global settings. Now you should bee able to sucessfully connect to the serial communication in Atoms terminal (click Connect Device).

## Circuit Diagram - Putting everything together
When Atom is up and running and your successfully able to communicate with the development board its time to make all the circuitry. For this tutorial a bread board is used as described earlier.
You will end with a bread board looking something like this below:
</br>![Bread board fritzing](fritzing/breadboard.png)

For thoose of you that want to use something else or design a PCB here is the schematic:
</br>![Schematic fritzing](fritzing/schematic.png)

Refering to the bread board image you can connect the component in which order you want. But I would recommend connecting LED first, and even connecting a battery source to understand how LED, current, and resistors are working. If you are using another LED and dont feel confident about reading resistor cheet you can use [this](https://circuitdigest.com/calculators/led-resistor-calculator) website.

Now I recommend connecting both buttons accordingly to the bread board image. The resistor that is being used acts as a pull-down resistor which garantes correct value from button.
